What is a Ping?
A ping test sends a small packet of data from your computer to the server and measures the amount of time it takes to get there.
This is done to see if there is any latency between the two devices.

What is a Traceroute?

A traceroute is used to determine the path that a packet of data takes on the network from your computer to the source or address you are trying to reach.
A traceroute records the amount of time taken for each hop the data packet makes on route to its destination.

What is the Difference?
The main difference between Ping and Traceroute is that Ping is a quick and easy utility to tell if the specified server is reachable and how long will it take to send and receive data from the server whereas Traceroute finds the exact route taken to reach the server and time taken by each step (hop).
