● Bark is a combination of software tools and resources to help parents keep their children safer online by monitoring and managing online activity.
● Bark is not only software, Bark is not just a computer. We have a team of highly trained online experts that are dedicated to helping keep children safer.
● At Bark, it’s our goal to help keep kids safer online while respecting their privacy as emerging digital citizens.
● Bark is able to let parents know if it detects alarming activity, but it is not able to send every text message, video view, or search history to parents.
● Your children will know that Bark is monitoring their devices, and you will need their usernames and passwords to monitor their accounts.
● We have found that Bark works best as a partnership between parents and children. Privacy is a touchy subject, especially among teens.
● We have seen many kids become more receptive to using Bark after learning more about how it works. I highly recommend discussing what Bark is and why you are using it with your children.

The A.I. Behind Bark
Our bread and butter is our AI behind Bark. It’s how we’ve set ourselves apart in this space. By only serving potential issues to parents, rather than everything on their kids devices in a list for them, the goal is that it helps parents and guardians be in the loop in the case they have to have a difficult conversation about an important topic while still appreciating reasonable privacy for their other activities on their devices, like joking around, talking about crushes, or whatever it may be. We alert on things like bullying, suicidal idealization, sexual predators, weapons, drug use, and more.

  
Machine-learning technology analyzes context, not just keywords.

●        Analyzes text, images, audio, and video.
●        Neural network is trained to understand the variations of slang, as well as how children and teens communicate differently than adults.
●        AI is trained in English, Spanish, and Afrikaans.
●        When we detect something alarming, we send the parent or guardian an alert that includes the worrisome conversation, photo, etc.
●        This feature is available on the Bark Premium subscription plan.
Notifications and Alerts
●        Notifications sent via text and email
●        View alerts in Bark website or parent’s app
●        Description of alert trigger
●        Snippet of the content
●        Device or account that triggered the alert
●        Time stamp

●   If Bark monitoring detects something alarming, it will generate an alert and send parents a notification via text and/or email.
●   Any number of email addresses and phone numbers may receive notifications, but only one email address and password may be used to log into Bark and review the alerts.
●   These alerts can be viewed in the Bark Parental Controls App on your mobile device, or by logging in to your Bark Dashboard from your web browser.
●   An alert will include a description of what triggered it (e.g. predatory behavior, cyber bullying, violence, sexual content, etc.)
●   It will also include snippet of the content that triggered it and any other information Bark is able to collect about that activity. This may include a portion of a conversation, media or links to media, names or usernames of the people involved, time stamps, etc.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
●Alerts are not generated in real-time, and the time required to generate an alert will vary between devices and accounts from a few minutes to a few hours.
●What Bark is able to gather may vary depending on the type of device, account, and app being monitored.
●No parent, child, or software tool is ever perfect. It is possible that something could be missed, or that you'll get an occasional alert from us when no actual issue exists. We are a tool to help families stay safer, not a replacement for an active, engaged parent.
●Bark may also send an alert if there is a technical issue preventing Bark from monitoring or filtering content on your child’s device. These alerts will include more information about which child and devices are affected as well as what may have caused the problem. This could be things like out of date software, a change in a child’s monitored account credentials, changes to settings on the device itself. Etc.

Premium vs Junior Bark

Our subscription plans include unlimited kids, unlimited devices! So a family only needs one plan. They can upgrade or downgrade their plan at any time. In general, customers find the most value out of the Premium plan.







What Bark monitors

1) Your Bark Premium membership has two primary features to help keep your child safe - content monitoring and web filtering.
2) Content monitoring is the contextual analysis of texts, photos, videos, social media, etc. on your child's device and connected accounts and web browsers for worrisome content.
3) Web filtering - blocking or allowing internet access to apps, websites, and the device.

●   Text messages- SMS/MMS/iMessages (including emojis, photos, videos, and audio within message)
●   Browser History- Chrome browsing only (Safari can instead be disabled).
●   Photos/Videos- Pictures sent in messages as well as saved to the camera roll. We analyze texts on top of photos
●   Email and Social Media- We will get into more of that on the next slide.
●   List of new apps installed on the device

Setting up monitoring

●   Bark can monitor content at the account-level or device-level.
●   At the account-level, parents can monitor a child’s email or social media account by connecting the child’s username and password. Requires either the parent or child to enter the child’s username and password to connect to Bark.
●   If a child is hesitant to share their username and password, parents are able to send a connection request so the child can enter this information remotely.
●   Once connected, Bark is able to monitor activity on that account no matter what device is used.
●   What Bark is able to monitor at the account level depends on the app and what content the app developers allow Bark to monitor - but may include a combination of text conversations, music, photos, and videos sent or received by the connected account.
●   At the device-level, parents can monitor things like text messages, photos and videos stored on the device itself, new apps downloaded on to the devices, and web browsing through the Chrome browser (Bark is not able to monitor other web browsing apps on Apple) on compatible Android and Apple devices.
●   There are a few differences between Android and Apple monitoring and a few exceptions to what can be monitored that we’ll discuss next.
Account Level
●        Requires child’s login credentials to connect

Once set up, follows account whether accessed on their device, a friend’s device, etc.

●        Email
●        Some social media
Device Level
●          Requires child’s device to connect
●          Monitors activities directly from the child’s device
●          Text
●          Pictures/videos
●          Some social media
How It Works:
●          Bark for Kids app installed on child’s device for both monitoring and web filtering
●          Cannot be deleted without password
What Bark Monitors on Android:
●          Text messages (SMS/MMS)
●          Saved Photos & Videos
●          List of downloaded apps
●          Chrome, Firefox, and stock web browsers
●          YouTube app browsing
●          Some apps that cannot be monitored at account level

●   Android devices can be monitored from the Bark for Kids App, which is downloaded directly onto the Android device itself.
●   In addition to content monitoring, this app also enforces Bark’s Screen Time and Web Filtering.
●   Bark will scan the Android device almost hourly and send alerts if it detects any alarming content.
●   Once installed, the Bark for Kids app cannot be adjusted or deleted by your child without your Bark username and password.

●   Bark is able to monitor text messages, photos & videos saved to the device, notes and voice memos, and a list of the downloaded apps
●   For Androids, Bark can monitor web browsing through Chrome, Firefox, and Stock Browsers like the Samsung Huawei Browser, Lemobile Browser, etc. (including Incognito/Private Mode on these apps)
●   Bark can also monitor YouTube browsing through both the YouTube app and through the web browser
●   Bark is also able able to monitor many app activities through a process called “scraping” - a method of pulling information off the screen as it is happening - which helps parents monitor some apps that cannot be connected by a username and password!

How It Works:
●          Monitoring Option 1:
Bark Desktop app downloaded on Windows or Mac computer

●          Monitoring Option 2:
Bark Home device connected to router
●          Monitoring is automatic via Wi-Fi (child’s iOS device must be on same network as computer or router)
●          Bark Kids app installed on child’s device for Web filtering only

What Bark Monitors on Apple:
●          Text messages (SMS/MMS)
●          Notes app
●          Voice memos
●          Saved photos & videos
●          List of downloaded apps
●          Kik & Whatsapp messages

●   Monitoring an Apple device is complex. This is because of Apple's stringent security on their devices, which prevents any third-party mobile apps (not just Bark) from monitoring device activities from an app on the device itself.
●   As a result, the only way to monitor the content on an iPhone is by transferring a copy of everything on your child’s Apple device to your computer (aka a “backup”), then compressing that data and sending it to Bark for analysis through the Bark Desktop App (run on either a Windows or Mac computer).
●   New alerts are therefore only sent after the Apple device is backed up to your computer.
●   After the first time setup over a USB cable, Bark can run these backups automatically over your home’s WI-FI network.
●   This means there aren’t any apps downloaded on your child’s device to maintain device-level monitoring, so there’s nothing for your child to uninstall, remove, or otherwise circumvent on the device itself to prevent content monitoring (at the device level)
●   You will need to download the Bark Kids app onto the device to enable Bark’s Screen Time and Web Filtering, but this does not affect content monitoring in any way.

Requirements:
●          Windows or Mac computer
●          Significant storage space
●          Stable internet connection
●          Wi-Fi network


Let’s take a closer look at the requirements you’ll need to monitor an Apple device

●   Requires a Windows or Mac computer - the Bark Desktop App is not compatible with Chromebooks or mobile devices
●   Bark backups are completely separate and unrelated to an iTunes or iCloud backup.
●   The Bark Desktop App copies all the data from your child’s device to your computer. That means you’ll need enough storage space on your computer for all of the data on all of your kids’ Apple devices. You can use an external hard drive to store this data. It cannot be stored in the cloud.
●   You’ll need a stable internet connection to upload the data to Bark’s servers.
●   After the initial backup, Bark is able to backup Apple devices automatically and wirelessly over your home’s Wi-Fi network whenever the device is connected to the home’s Wi-Fi network. To do this, your computer must remain on, awake, and connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
●   Apple devices must be backed up regularly, preferably at least once every day, to maintain ongoing device monitoring.
●   The Bark Desktop App will attempt to connect with your child’s device via Wi-Fi and run an automatic backup if more than 6-8 hours have passed since the last backup.
●   If no backups have been run in a few days, Bark will start sending parents a notification that their child’s device is missing a backup.
●   After receiving the backup, alerts may be available in a few minutes to a few hours depending on the volume of data being analyzed and the load on Bark’s servers. The most severe alerts will be sent as soon as they are detected. Less severe alerts will be batched and sent once the analysis is complete.


Requirements:
●          The Bark Home device (add-on they can purchase from Bark or Amazon)
●          Compatible router (list found on Bark's knowledge base)
●          Wi-Fi network (for automatic monitoring)
●          Available for Android, iOS, Chromebook
●          Should only be installed on kids’ devices
●          Installs a VPN on the device for web filtering

How Screen Time & Web Filtering Work with Bark


Screen time & web filtering, also known as on-the-go controls or in-home controls, prohibit or allow access to particular websites, apps, and internet services. When set up, you can...

     ○ Manage schedules like School Time, Bedtime, Free Time for school nights and weekends
     ○ Filter which categories of websites your kids can visit (such as social media, streaming, gaming, and sexual content)
     ○ Block which apps/sites they can use at what times
     ○ Turn off the internet when needed (while still allowing texts and calls)

●   Web Filtering requires either the Bark VPN or Bark Home
●   The VPN or Bark Home acts like a bouncer, it will allow or block websites and online apps based on the rules you set up under Bark’s Screen Time
●   The Bark VPN is installed through the Bark Kids app on your Apple or Android phones.



What is Bark Home?




1.   Bark home is a physical device that connects to your home’s Wi-Fi router. Think of it as a filter on the router itself that blocks or allows internet traffic to any device on that Wi-Fi network.
2.   Bark Home is purchased separately on Amazon for a one time fee and can be used with or without an active Bark membership!
3.   With Bark Home, parents can apply Bark’s Screen Time and Web Filtering rules to Wi-Fi devices that aren’t compatible with the Bark VPN. This includes computers, laptops, video game consoles, smart TVs and more
4.    You can use manage the Screen Time rules and schedules for all Wi-Fi devices in your home from one place

Bark Home is compatible with most routers, but there are some exceptions.
Platforms We Know Parents Are Worried About
●   For Instagram and YouTube - Bark is able to monitor some things at the account-level and others at the device level, and there are some exceptions between Android and Apple devices.
●   For some apps like Snapchat, TikTok, Discord, Holla, and Houseparty account monitoring is not available for any service, not just Bark.
●   This is because these apps flat out refuse to allow any third party to integrate with their platform to monitor minors.
●   To get these platforms monitored for worrisome content, you will need to download the Bark for Kids app onto your child's Android.
●   Monitoring for some of these apps is available for Android but not Apple. That's because Android devices are a little more relaxed than Apple, allowing the owner of the phone to grant permissions to third parties like Bark to do more stuff.
●   As such, we were able to design the Bark for Kids app to monitor your child's activities from the device itself by allowing app permissions!




-   At the account-level, Bark monitors your child's posts on their account, which includes images, videos, and captions for those posts.
-   Bark is able to monitor Instagram direct messages at the device-level for Android devices, but cannot monitor these messages on Apple devices
-   The same is true for search terms within the Instagram Search Bar





-   Snapchat does not allow any service to monitor their accounts.
-   Because Apple’s stringent security measures prevent monitoring apps from being installed, it is not possible to monitor Snapchat on Apple products.
-   The Bark for Kids app can monitor the direct/private  text conversations, but cannot pick up the images that are being sent





-   At the account-level - Bark can monitor the videos posted to your child’s account, the comments on those videos, the videos your child likes, and any new videos posted to the channels your child subscribes to.
-   To monitor the videos your child searches and views,  you must monitor the device they use to search and view those videos.
-   On Android Devices, Bark can monitor YouTube views and searches through both the YouTube app as well as through the device’s web browser.
-   On Apple devices, Bark can monitor YouTube views and searches through the Chrome Browser, but not the YouTube app




-   Discord, like Snapchat, does not allow any service to monitor their accounts
-   Similarly, Bark is able to monitor direct Discord messages on an Android device, but cannot monitor Discord on Apple products
-   Bark cannot monitor Discord messages sent in public or private servers, but can monitor direct messages (text only)



-   Tik Tok is also like Snapchat and Discord - it does not allow any service to monitor its accounts
-   Therefore, once again, Bark is able to monitor the direct texts on Android devices, but cannot monitor Tik Tok at all on Apple products
-   Bark cannot monitor TikTok videos




●   Bark is able to monitor the Direct Messages, Searches, and some media in direct messages on Instagram through an Android device.
●   Messenger Kids cannot be monitored on Apple products
●   Searches, photos, images, and videos in Messenger Kids cannot be monitored by Bark.
