Connecting to the router’s WiFi:
·        Ensure that the wireless is enabled on your device and search for your specific WiFi name. Once you have found the 2.4GHz SSID, click on connect.

·        Please check the back of the router/manual for these details

·        Put in the wireless key/password when prompt – this can be found at the bottom of the router along with the SSID.

Logging into the router’s interface:
·        Once connected to the router following the above via cable or WiFi, open an internet browser.

·        Enter the router’s default IP (which can be found at the bottom of the router) in the address bar of the browser – by default, the username and password is “admin”.

·        If you cannot see the default login details or default IP, please check the manual that came with the router.

Setting up PPPoE (Username and password authentication):
·        If this is the first time that you are setting up the router or if you have reset the device and lost all previous settings, please follow the below steps.
·        On the left pane, go to Network > WAN > select PPPoE as the Connection Type.

·        Enter the username and password provided by your ISP.

·        These fields are case-sensitive 

 

Resetting your router:
With the router powered on, hold down the reset button (for 10-15 seconds) until the lights start to flash.
Release the button and wait for the router to reboot to its default settings.
 

Troubleshooting: No connection:
Check that the telephone cable is plugged securely into the Telkom wall socket and at the back of the router.
Confirm that the PPPoE username and password are correct.
Check for damage on the telephone cable and that it is connected to the ADSL line splitter - if the cable is damaged you will need to replace it.
Connect the router directly into your Telkom socket, bypassing all micro-filters and listen for dial tone. If no dial tone, the customer will need to contact Telkom.
Make a phone call to any number. If you hear noise or interference on the line, advise the customer to contact Telkom.
