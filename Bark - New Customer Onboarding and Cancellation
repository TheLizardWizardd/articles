Onboarding

Once a client has signed up for Bark they are sent an email like the below welcoming them to Bark


On clicking the Set up my account button in the email the user will be presented with the following webpage


Once they have chosen their password and checked the two agreement options they are asked what issues they are most concerned about


Once the client has made their selection they click Next and will then be asked to setup the profile for their child

If they have more than one child they can continue adding them from here until they have added all their children.


You will then be asked to select the devices each child needs to have secured by Bark


The customer will then choose how alerts reach them by providing Cellphone and Email address options.

The initial setup is now complete and the parent is shown a checklist of actions to take to finish setting up their children and devices for monitoring.

--------------------------------------

The client is sent an email informing them the setup for each child is not complete and asking them to finish connecting their child, please note this is only if they did not immediately complete the setup from instructions in the portal.

The client is also sent a link to a video for the relevant devices in the email.

As an example the link in the email above (link) is for a child with an Android device and redirects you to the following video in the Bark portal.




An additional email is also sent to the client with download instructions for the Parental Control App for their phones

On following the link you will login to the Bark portal with the details setup in the previous sections and the relevant software downloads will be available for supported devices
