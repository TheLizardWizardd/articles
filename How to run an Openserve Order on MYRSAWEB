How to run an Openserve Order on MYRSAWEB

DO NOT RUN SERVICES FOR API FNO's (Octotel, Vumatel, Frogfoot)

Openserve is the only provider that requires the services to be run in order for the customer to connect

We are able to see the schedule for Openserve installs by checking your email for a mail from : OpenServe.Reports@openserve.co.za


On that email you will find an excel spreadsheet attached showing the orders and their status.

A - Column A is the order number which you will see on Myrsaweb on the order number you will be running
G - Column G is the circuit number
I - Column I should always be Putting-into-Service for you to activate
M - Column M is the go live date which is when the service should be run from (not from when customer calls in).


Please note we do not however have to wait for them to appear on the daily report to run the order!

The daily report and assurance portal only gets updated 24 hours later. We cannot keep a customer waiting for 24 hours to get their service added.

If the client calls in we can check the below and assist further as required.

Are they seeing three green lights on the ONT ( PWR/Power , PON , LAN)? if these lights are the ones displaying then the service
Ask for their B number (which is found on their ONT). if they have their B-number then you can run the order
