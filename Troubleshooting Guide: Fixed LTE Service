Troubleshooting Guide: Fixed LTE Service

 

 

1. General Service Information

Fixed Service: The LTE router is tied to a fixed address and cannot be moved between premises.
Location Restriction: The router operates only within 5 KM of the RICA-registered address unless a change is requested. However, moving the router frequently—even within that 5 KM radius—can lead to an unstable connection. We cannot guarantee service quality if the router is relocated from the activation address.
Address Changes: Customers can change their address up to 4 times a year, subject to feasibility. Please note that once the new coordinates are updated, the automation process may take up to 48 hours
 

 

2. RICA Process

RICA Limitations:
RICA may fail if multiple lines are registered under a specific ID, triggering an error: RICA Pre-Paid Registration Threshold Per ID/Passport Number Limit Reached.
In this case, send a copy of the customer's ID and proof of address to MTN. No later than 3months. Processing this request can take up to 48 hours.
RICA Confirmation:
To confirm successful RICA, check the customer's order profile for confirmation or error messages.
Increasing RICA Threshold:
For individuals: Send a copy of the ID and proof of address to uplift the threshold. ETA: 2-3 days.
For businesses: Send the director’s ID, proof of address, and a company letterhead.
Customer Portal: A customer uses the Enterprise FLTE Management Portal to place and track orders. Timeline: The process typically takes 2-5 days from order placement to completion.

 

 

3. Service Management & Usage

Uncapped Data Plans:
Plans are uncapped but subject to a Fair Usage Policy (FUP). Exceeding the FUP results in a speed limit of 2Mbps.
Customers will receive notifications when they approach their threshold, giving them time to top up if necessary.

4. Router Setup Instructions

If the client chose a package that includes a router, it will likely be the below router. However, long-term clients might have our discontinued ZTE routers or a third-party router that is Fixed LTE approved. New clients with SIM-only packages may also have their own router—ensure it is Fixed LTE approved before troubleshooting.

 

Please note, the list below shows the routers provided by RSAWEB the client may have, with links to their information

5.    Common Troubleshooting Scenarios

For all Fixed LTE services (capped & uncapped), the most important step is to always check if the customer has been capped and throttled on the Fixed LTE portal.

 

Activation

Check if the service is running in Myrsaweb. If not, the issue might be a failed connection.
No Connection

After completing the initial checks—such as verifying correct lights and ensuring the client is active on the portal without throttling or capping—it's important to perform the following checks before escalating.

Remove SIM card.
Ensure the router has been rebooted or hard reset (press the reset button using a toothpick or paperclip).
Reinsert the SIM card.
Check APN settings:
PDP Type: IPv4
Profile Name: RSAWEB
APN: ws.rsaweb.fwa
Check the signal light (3G/4G) and verify the signal strength in the router’s status information.
Slow Speeds

Is the issue affecting all connected devices?
Perform a speed test on both RSAWEB and MTN servers.
Run a speed test using the Speedtest.net app at https://www.speedtest.net, and make sure to test both the RSAWEB and MTN servers.

Move the router to different areas to improve signal strength.
Reboot and reconfigure the router if necessary.
Connection Drops

Ensure no devices are consuming high bandwidth in the background.
Verify the router’s signal strength.
Run ping and traceroute tests for further diagnostics.
 

After completing all the checks, escalate the ticket with all relevant information. The fault will then be logged with the appropriate team (MTN, DEV, or NOC).

 

6. Portal Information and Reporting a Fault

The escalation team reviews the MTN portal for backend issues and any alerts that might affect the customer experience
