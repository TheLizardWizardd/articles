FTTB Lite
Introduction


FTTB Lite is the entry level Business fiber solution. It comes with  FTTH pricing and has the FTTH SLA applied to it as well.

This means they will get the support of FTTH customers NOT FTTB customers.

These customers will also get the normal standard FTTH TPlink routers, not the Mikrotik routers and these will be dispatched via courier. 

The main differences between the normal FTTB products and the FTTB Lite as follows:



Areas

This product is only available to clients in Knysna, Plett and Sedgefield

Speeds

The following speeds are available for FTTB Lite on the Octotel network.

35/25 Mbps
50/50 Mbps

These services are listed as FTTH in myrsaweb which correctly indicates it is a consumer product despite being sold as a FTTB service
