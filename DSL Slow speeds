Troubleshooting: Slow speeds:
·        Perform a speed test
·        Close all applications and other services that might be using the internet.

·        Connect to your router using a network cable (no WiFi) and disable the WiFi to all other devices, or turn off the WiFi of the router.

·        Navigate to https://www.speedtest.net/, choose the RSAWEB test server and perform the test.

·        If your results are below 80% of your bandwidth, continue with the below.

 

·        ADSL Splitter
·        Unplug all devices from every phone socket, including routers, telephone, fax machines and other devices using the line.

·        Connect your telephone handset directly in to the phone socket.

·        Listen for dial tone and make a call to any number to ensure there is no noise or interference on the line.

·        If there is noise such as static, echo or distortion, the customer will need to log a fault with Telkom.

 

·        WiFi signal
·        Connect only one PC or Laptop to the router with a cable.

·        Turn off the router’s WiFi and disconnect any other devices.

·        Rerun the speed test.

·        If the speeds are still slow, try using a different phone cable to connect between the router and phone socket, and a different ethernet to your PC.

·        Rerun the speed test and see if it improves.

 

·        Router
·        If possible, connect a different router for testing.

·        If a different router improves the speeds being achieved, the first router may be faulty.

·        If the speeds are still slow, please log a fault to Telkom.
