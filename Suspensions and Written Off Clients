The collection process was created to automatically start sending notices and put customers profiles and in some cases, services in different states depending on at which point they are. They will be added to this process either automatically or manually when they have an outstanding balance when payment is due. The purpose of this is to collect the money owed to us.

 

Current Process

Payment methods: 

 

Currently we only automatically suspend debit order customers. How this works is when a customer's payment bounces it will automatically add them to the collections process.

 

 

Service suspensions:

 

The following services gets automatically suspended via PSM (in other words, the provider won’t know they suspended, but we cut them off via our side): A reminder clients are still billed for their services whilst suspended. These clients get handled directly by accounts and does not touch projects or support. Suspending and unsuspending these clients are handled on Accounts Side.

-       Octotel

-       LTE

-       Openserve

 

The following services can get manually suspended by removing their IP. Helpdesk manages this. Only they can remove and readd the IP. Suspension noticed need to go to support to suspend and reactivate.

-       Vumatel

 

The following services can not be suspended, these services are not on our PSM yet. We therefore cannot effect their services when they are suspended. We do not need to be told that they are suspended or unsuspended for this reason.

-       Frogfoot

-       Century City Connect

-       SADV

-       Vuma Aerial (Fibrehoods)

 

All other services do not get suspended, some of them being hosting, cloud, mobile data, mobile broadband, and the list goes on.

 

Internal Staff Communication and Notes

Important: 

 

Please note that the general communication to be given to the customers are that without payment their services will be cancelled, which means that they will have to pay cancellation fees, as well as pay for the new installation, setup fee, etc. which in some cases, can take a couple of weeks for them to be connected again.

 

Note:

 

If you are not accounts (Finance) you are, in no way allowed to change the status of the collections process on the customers account, or activate/un-suspend services without authorisation from the Accounts team.

 

Statuses / Transitions

One of the reasons why the internal communication around cancellations are so important, is due to the fact that the status of the account (in the collection process) is not the same you see on the customers profile. Most of them show suspended, but would have already started cancellation of services. The run from top down.
