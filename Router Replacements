Router Upgrades Due to Line Speed Upgrades
When handling router replacements for clients who require upgrades due to line speed upgrades please follow these steps:
 1. Effective Client Communication:
When a client's router is limited to 100 Mbps and an upgrade is necessary, it is essential to clearly communicate the need for a better router, as well as inform them about any associated carrier costs.

 2. Flexible Router Replacement Options:
We have provided two options for clients to choose from when replacing their routers:

   a. Courier Service: Clients have the convenience of opting for our courier service to facilitate the router swap. A nominal fee of R390 will be charged to cover the associated costs.
   b. Office/Warehouse Swap: Alternatively, clients can personally visit our office/warehouse to exchange their router, thereby avoiding any courier charges.

 Please note the router RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) approval process is strictly reserved for faulty hardware replacements.

Rental Routers and Replacements
If a client's go-live date was before 2020, it means they received a router from us under different contract terms at that time. These routers were not rental units. Prior to 2020, if a client had the router for more than 12 months, it was considered their property.

However, for new clients who received a router after 2020, it was provided as a rental unit.

1.Clients who went live prior to 2020 and need a new router due to issues with their non-rental router: They are eligible for a rental router. In this case, we can courier a rental unit to them for R195. The faulty router they have, which was acquired prior to 2020, belongs to them. It's important to note that if they decide to cancel their service, the new rental router must be returned.

2.Clients who went live after 2020 and need to replace a rental router: In this situation, the courier fees amount to R390. This includes a delivery fee of R195 and a collection fee of R195. The carrier charges RSAWEB twice for both deliveries and collections, which is why it is doubled. 

 When we receive the faulty router, we ship it to our supplier for replacement, and the recycled unit is then provided to a new client.
