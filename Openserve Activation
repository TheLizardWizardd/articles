Activation
After the customer installation has been completed by Openserve you will be able to confirm if the service is activated in the Openserve portal by going to "My Openserve" and then "Query order status"


Search with the B-number that you will need to get from the customer and confirm the order status is "Done"


After confirming that the service is now live, you will need to activate the customer's service under Order on their profile.
