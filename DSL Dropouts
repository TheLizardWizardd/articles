DSL Dropouts
Table of contents
WiFi signal
Stand next to the router to rule out signal issues - move further away and see if the drops persist.
If the connection drops in certain parts of the house, proceed with improving the wireless signal.
Check other devices connected to the routers via wifi and cable to see if those drop connections too.
If possible, check if devices dropout via an ethernet cable (laptop or PC)
If the connection drops over cable, you will need to troubleshoot your broadband connection

ADSL Splitter
Unplug all devices from every phone socket, including routers, telephone, fax machines and other devices using the line.
Connect your telephone handset directly into the phone socket.
Listen for dial tone and make a call to any number to ensure there is no noise or interference on the line.
If there is noise such as static, echo or distortion, the customer will need to log a fault with Telkom.
Any damaged or outdated cables should be replaced.
